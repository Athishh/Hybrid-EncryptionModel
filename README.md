# Hybrid Encryption Model

<h4>Military grade encryption using a hybrid of symmetric and asymmetric encryption schemes</h4>
<h3>1st Generation Model</h3>
</div>




This project is a Java-based encryption model that uses a combination of symmetric (AES-256) 
and asymmetric (RSA) encryption. The symmetric encryption is used for encrypting the actual data, 
while the asymmetric encryption is used for encrypting the symmetric key.

This is the 1st Generation of the encryption model used in the Baphomet program loader & security system 
developed by me & owned by @baphsec. Specifically, used for encrypting the data sent between the clients and servers.
It was later replaced with a much more advanced and secure system in the later generations of Baphomet. 
(I'm currently developing the 5th Generation! That's how much time has passed after this was made)

The code is still here for anyone who wants to use it for their own projects or learn from it.
You don't even have to credit me if you don't want to :D
